# Virtual Raking Light

Simulate a moving raking light in your browser using OpenSeadragon.

Move your mouse to move the light across a painting or any other object photographed with raking light. Requires 8 directional raking images and 1 raking-all image and/or 1 regular image. 

Supports simple images and tile sources such as DZI and IIIF. Implemented in pure HTML/CSS/JS.

## Local setup

Pull the repo.

Edit `urls` in `index.html` to point to your own images*.

Run a local server** and open index.html in a browser.

<sup>*The code is currently set to use simple images (JPG's), but it also supports tile sources such as DZI and IIIF.</sup>

<sup>**[Live Server for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is a useful option.</sup>

## To-do's

Add an animated GIF to the README to preview what it looks like.

See TODO flags in index.html.
